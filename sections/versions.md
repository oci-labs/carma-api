## Versions

Version numbering for the API is based on semantic versioning
(http://semver.org/) and a client written to a major version is guaranteed
to continue working for all subsequent minor and patch versions.

The current major version will always be available along with the
immediately preceding major version.  The major version 2 levels previous
will be deprecated on release of a new major version and then obsoleted
on the release of the next version.

This means that there will always be the current and two preceding
versions of the API available for use.  Use of the current version is
always encouraged.
